# Kali-Update-Script
# Usage Instructions (enter these commands into a terminal on the Linux system that you wish to update):

git clone https://github.com/gnarlyhaze/Kali-Update-Script.git 

cd Kali-Update-Script

chmod u+x ./*

sudo ./Update.sh

# Description:
This script is for updating, and performing basic configuration on Linux distros that use apt as the package manager (ie. Kali, Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu).

This means that if you're using a different package manager such as yum (ie. RedHat, Fedora, OpenSuse) then this script will probably not work on your OS.

I did not create any of the desktop backgrounds that are downloaded with this repo but I think that they are cool pictures to use as background images.

There are some other miscellaneous scripts that I did create contained in the download that you may find helpful.
